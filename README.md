# python academic examples
Work in Progress

Not meant for practical use; for educational purposes only.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate concepts, such as what certain alogrithms do,
using Python syntax to keep things simple,
even though the code will be doing things that don't make sense to do in Python.
