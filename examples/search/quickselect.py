quickselect algorithm
find k-th smallest item in an unordered list

Works by separating smaller items onto one side of the pivot,
not caring about the particular order but about the number of smaller items on that side.
For example, with k of 5,
the 5th smallest item will have 4 items smaller than it partitioned to its left.

in theory, quick sort partition method should be the same for quick select
can they share a method?
